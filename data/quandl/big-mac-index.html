<a href="https://www.quandl.com/data/ECONOMIST">The Economist - Big Mac Index</a> (Code: <span>ECONOMIST</span>)<br/>
The Big Mac index was invented by The Economist in 1986 as a lighthearted
guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. It is based on the
theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP).
